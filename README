NAME
    WWW::ActiveState::PPM - Scrape build status from the ActiveState build
    farm

DESCRIPTION
    THIS MODULE IS CONSIDERED EXPERIMENTAL

    API OR FUNCTIONALITY MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE

    YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

    This module is used to extract the build state of all the modules from
    the ActiveState PPM website, located at <http://ppm.activestate.com/>.

METHODS
  new
      my $scraper = WWW::ActiveState::PPM->new(
          trace   => 0,
          version => '5.10',
      );

    The "new" constructor creates a new website scraping object.

    The optional boolean "trace" param (off by default) is supplied to make
    the scraping object print status to STDOUT as it runs.

    The optional "version" param (5.10 by default) is used to set the
    version of Perl that the scraper should target. Legal values are '5.6',
    '5.8' and '5.10'.

    Returns a new WWW::ActiveState::PPM object, or throws an exception on
    error.

  trace
    The "trace" accessor is used to discover if tracing is enabled for the
    object.

  version
    The "version" accessor returns the version of Perl that the scraper is
    targetting.

  run
    The "run" method is used to kick off the parsing process.

    Returns true when all packages have been checked, or throws an exception
    if an error occurs.
